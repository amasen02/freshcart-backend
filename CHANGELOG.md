## [Unreleased]

### Security

- Eliminated the critical `Marten` full-text-search SQL-injection advisory (GHSA-vmw2-qwm8-x84c) by
  upgrading `Marten` 7.30.0 &rarr; 8.37.0 (the first patched release); bumped the central `Npgsql` pin
  to 9.0.4 to satisfy Marten 8's transitive floor, and migrated the two relocated Marten 8 symbols
  (`AutoCreate`, `ConcurrencyException`, now under the consolidated `JasperFx` namespace) in
  `Basket` and `Catalog`.
- Cleared the high-severity `MessagePack` (GHSA-hv8m-jj95-wg3x &rarr; 2.5.301 transitive pin) and
  `Snappier` (GHSA-pggp-6c3x-2xmx &rarr; 1.3.1) advisories; advanced `SharpCompress` to 0.47.4.
- Replaced the blanket `NU1902;NU1903` warning demotion in `Directory.Build.props` with two targeted,
  documented `NuGetAuditSuppress` entries for the only two transitives with no published fix
  (`SharpCompress` path-traversal, `SQLitePCLRaw` bundled-SQLite), each reached on a non-exploitable
  path &mdash; so any *new* or *patchable* vulnerability now fails the build again.
- Removed committed credentials from every base `appsettings.json` across **10 services** (Basket,
  Catalog, Ordering, Payment, Identity, Inventory, Pricing, Delivery, Notification, CustomerSupport,
  Reviews, Reporting): the credential-bearing `ConnectionStrings` and `MessageBroker` blocks now live in
  `appsettings.Development.json` (dev-only), matching the existing `Jwt:SigningKey` convention. Production
  and the Aspire AppHost inject these via environment at runtime; base config is now credential-free.
- **Service-to-service authentication.** The Ordering saga previously called Payment (HTTP) and
  Inventory (gRPC) with no credential, while those endpoints required authorization &mdash; a latent
  failure of the integrated checkout in any environment that enforces auth. Introduced a shared
  `ServiceAuthenticationDefaults` (role `ServiceAccount`, policy `ServiceCaller`) and a cached
  `ServiceTokenProvider` in Ordering that mints a short-lived JWT signed with the shared key; a
  `DelegatingHandler` attaches it to Payment calls and a gRPC metadata header to Inventory calls. The
  Payment capture endpoint and the Inventory reserve/release gRPC service now require the `ServiceCaller`
  policy instead of "any authenticated user", which also closes the Payment capture BOLA (`CustomerId`
  was trusted from the request body) and the bare-`[Authorize]` gRPC surface.
- **CSRF enforcement (Identity).** Added the missing `app.UseAntiforgery()` to the pipeline and a reusable
  `AntiforgeryConfiguration.ValidateBrowserRequestAsync` that validates the `XSRF-TOKEN` / `X-XSRF-TOKEN`
  double-submit pair (issued but never validated) for cookie-bearing browser requests, while deliberately
  skipping bearer / service callers that carry no ambient cookie and are not CSRF-exposed. The validator is
  safe-method-aware (read endpoints are unaffected) and is enforced on sign-out and on the MFA
  enroll/verify/disable mutations via a group endpoint filter (ID-SEC-01).
- **Invoice-download BOLA and path traversal (REP-005).** The two invoice GET routes
  (`/invoices/{invoiceNumber}` and `.../content.pdf`) carried only the group-level `RequireAuthorization`,
  so any authenticated customer could enumerate the gap-free invoice numbers and download other customers'
  invoice PDFs (names, addresses, line items). Both now require the `BackOfficeUser` role like every other
  reporting route. `StreamPdfAsync` also passed the raw route value straight into the blob path; it now
  validates via `InvoiceNumber.TryParse` and addresses the blob with the normalised `parsed.Value`,
  returning 400 on malformed input.
- Verified: full solution builds with 0 errors; the entire test suite is green &mdash;
  Basket 92, Catalog 155, Payment 85, Ordering 71, Delivery 56, Reviews 53, CustomerSupport 46,
  Pricing 47, Notification 42, Identity 40, Gateway 38, BuildingBlocks 46, Reporting 42, Inventory 7.

### Reliability

- **Outbox poison-message dead-lettering (BB-001).** A message that repeatedly failed to publish was
  re-fetched and re-failed on every drain cycle forever, wedging the queue behind it. `OutboxMessage.MarkFailed`
  now dead-letters a message once it reaches `OutboxPublisherOptions.MaxRetryAttempts` (default 5): it is
  stamped processed so the publisher stops polling it, the reason is recorded with a `DEAD-LETTERED` marker,
  and the publisher raises a Critical alert. The decision is centralised on the entity (unit-tested with no
  database); both the Marten (Basket) and EF Core (Ordering) stores delegate to it. No schema change required.
- **Notification redelivery on a recipient race (NOTIF-001).** `PaymentFailedConsumer` and
  `OrderRefundedConsumer` silently acknowledged (dropped) the event whenever the recipient lookup found
  nothing &mdash; which happens when the event outruns the `OrderPlaced` / `OrderConfirmed` projection that
  records the recipient. They now throw, so MassTransit's bounded exponential retry redelivers (and
  dead-letters to the error queue once the budget is exhausted), turning a silent drop into at-least-once
  delivery with an observable failure.
- **Idempotent stock seeding (INV-001).** `ProductCreatedConsumer` overwrote the stock row on every
  delivery via an upsert, so an at-least-once redelivery reset `QuantityOnHand` to the initial value and
  wiped real stock movement. New `IStockRepository.EnsureExistsAsync` (atomic insert-if-absent via
  `MERGE ... WHEN NOT MATCHED`) and `IStockLevelService.EnsureStockItemAsync` seed the row only on first
  sight; the consumer now uses them, and the destructive `SetStockLevel` is reserved for the admin PUT.
- **Atomic delivery-slot booking (DLV-001).** `ScheduleDeliveryService` listed a slot, incremented its
  booked count in memory, then persisted it with an unconditional `Set` filtered only by id, so two
  `OrderConfirmed` consumers that both read a slot at 4/5 each wrote 5 &mdash; oversubscribing the fleet.
  `ISlotRepository.UpdateBookingAsync` becomes `TryBookSlotAsync`, a single `UpdateOne` with
  `Inc(BookedCount, 1)` filtered by `id AND BookedCount < Capacity`; exactly one racing scheduler gets
  `ModifiedCount == 1`. The booking now precedes creating the delivery, and a lost race throws the
  retriable `SlotNoLongerAvailableException` so the MassTransit retry re-schedules against the remaining
  open slots. Proven with a 20-way concurrent Testcontainers test.
- **Exactly-once warehouse projections (REP-001).** The reporting projection consumers checked an EF
  inbox, applied a Dapper projection, then recorded the inbox &mdash; three steps across two connections.
  A crash between the apply and the record re-applied the event on redelivery, and both the refund total
  and the customer lifetime value are additive, so the redelivery silently double-counted. The inbox
  record now shares the projection's Dapper transaction: `WarehouseProjectionWriter` inserts the
  `projection_inbox` row first as a primary-key latch, applies the projection, and commits atomically; a
  duplicate key means already-processed (returns `false`). The standalone `IProjectionInbox` is removed.
  Proven with MySQL Testcontainers tests for redelivery and 12-way concurrent delivery.
- **Atomic invoice-number allocation (REP-002).** `AllocateNextNumberAsync` claimed a `FOR UPDATE` lock
  but did a plain EF read-increment-save with no concurrency token, so concurrent invoice generation
  handed two invoices the same number. It is now a single atomic upsert
  (`INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE LastSequence = LAST_INSERT_ID(LastSequence + 1)`) read back via the
  session-scoped `LAST_INSERT_ID()`. Proven with a 25-way concurrent Testcontainers test yielding exactly
  `{1..25}`.
- **Refresh-token rotation race (ID-COR-01).** `RefreshTokenService.RotateAsync` read the token, checked
  `IsActive`, then revoked it and issued a replacement in a tracked read-then-write with no concurrency
  guard, so two requests racing on the same token both passed the check and both rotated &mdash; minting
  two live tokens from one and defeating reuse detection. Rotation is now claimed with a single atomic
  conditional `ExecuteUpdate` that revokes the token only while it is still active; a zero-row result means
  another request already rotated it (indistinguishable from a stolen-token replay) and the whole token
  family is revoked. A single statement rather than a transaction because the DbContext uses a retrying
  execution strategy, which forbids user-initiated transactions; a crash between claim and re-issue fails
  closed (forced re-authentication). Proven with an 8-way concurrent SQL Server Testcontainers test in
  which exactly one rotation succeeds.
- **Refund flow auth and idempotency (ORD-002).** Two defects in the admin order-refund path
  (admin &rarr; Ordering &rarr; Payment). First, the Payment refund endpoint required the `Administrator`
  policy while Ordering calls it with the service token, so every refund failed with 403; it now requires
  `ServiceCallerPolicy` like the capture endpoint (the administrator check is enforced at the Ordering
  edge). Second, the refund carried no idempotency key, so an Ordering retry after its own save failed
  (the provider had already refunded) would refund the customer a second time. The refund endpoint now
  requires an `Idempotency-Key` header (Ordering sends the payment id, stable for its one-full-refund flow);
  the key is recorded on the `PaymentRefunded` event and the handler replays the recorded outcome instead
  of re-refunding when the key is already present. Proven with a handler test (retry replays without
  touching the provider) plus aggregate and validator tests.
- **Stable integration-event contract name (BB-002).** `IntegrationEvent.EventType` returned
  `GetType().AssemblyQualifiedName`, and the outbox publisher resolves the CLR type from it via
  `Type.GetType(EventType)` before deserialising and publishing. Because the assembly-qualified name
  embeds the assembly version, an event sitting in the outbox across a deployment that bumped the version
  would fail to resolve and be dead-lettered &mdash; a live event silently lost. `EventType` now returns
  the version-independent `Type.FullName`, and a new `EventContractTypeResolver` resolves it robustly
  (direct lookup, then a loaded-assembly scan) so resolution no longer depends on the assembly version or
  on which assembly hosts the publisher; legacy assembly-qualified rows still resolve, so no migration is
  needed. Proven with resolver tests (stable name, legacy name, unknown name) and a contract-name format test.
- **Outbox multi-instance claim guard (BSK-01).** Both outbox stores fetched unpublished rows with a plain
  `Where(ProcessedOnUtc == null).Take(batchSize)` and no row lock, so two publisher replicas draining
  concurrently fetched and published the same messages (duplicate publishes; tolerated only because
  consumers are idempotent). Locking during the fetch would not have helped &mdash; the publisher fetches,
  publishes, and marks-published in separate operations, so a fetch-time lock is released before the
  publish. Instead each drain now *claims* its batch: it selects candidate ids, then an atomic conditional
  update stamps a per-drain `ClaimId`/`ClaimedOnUtc` only on rows still unclaimed (or whose lease lapsed),
  and returns just the rows this call won &mdash; so two replicas always claim disjoint sets. A lapsed
  lease (`OutboxMessage.ClaimLeaseTimeout`) re-claims messages stranded by a crashed replica, and a
  transient publish failure releases the claim for prompt retry. Implemented with EF Core `ExecuteUpdate`
  (Ordering/SQL Server) and Marten `Patch` (Basket/PostgreSQL) &mdash; no raw SQL. Proven with a concurrent
  two-drainer Testcontainers test per store (SQL Server + PostgreSQL) asserting disjoint claims and that
  every message is claimed exactly once.

### Fixed

- **AppHost is now runnable headlessly.** Added the missing
  `src/AspireAppHost/FreshCart.AppHost/Properties/launchSettings.json`; without it a plain
  `dotnet run` on the AppHost crashed immediately (`ASPNETCORE_URLS` / `ASPIRE_DASHBOARD_OTLP_ENDPOINT_URL`
  not set) and child services started outside Development (so the dev `Jwt:SigningKey` was missing). The
  profile sets the dashboard URLs, OTLP endpoints and `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development`. Two further
  live-boot blockers (Aspire persistent-container password drift; databases not provisioned on fresh
  volumes) are documented with the required fix in `docs/google-standards-audit-2026-06-23.md` §7.
- **The full stack now cold-boots and the customer-journey E2E passes against the live system (audit §7).**
  Implemented the §7 recipe &mdash; stable AppHost parameter passwords in `appsettings.Development.json`,
  Postgres database creation via Marten `CreateDatabasesForTenants` (Catalog, Basket), and
  `EnableRetryOnFailure` on the Identity and Payment DbContexts &mdash; and fixed the latent integration
  bugs only a live boot exposes: the gateway JWT role-claim type (`ClaimTypes.Role`), dev-cert trust on
  service-to-service HTTP and gRPC channels, Pricing gRPC `[AllowAnonymous]`, the sign-up cookie missing
  its roles, the Payment capture/refund DTO field/shape mismatches, and the Payment read-model
  cross-column CHECK. The Playwright `customer-journey` spec now runs green end-to-end against
  `dotnet run` AppHost + `ng serve`, and a real order reaches `Confirmed`
  (Submitted &rarr; StockReserved &rarr; Confirmed) through the MassTransit saga.

### Planned &mdash; future phases

- **v0.9.0** &mdash; AdminBackoffice modular monolith (`IModule` pattern) and the Angular 20
  admin SPA.
- **v0.10.0** &mdash; Per-service Bicep modules and helm charts for Reporting and
  AdminBackoffice.
- **v0.11.0** &mdash; Contract tests (Pact provider verification) and load tests (k6) for
  every service.
- **v1.0.0** &mdash; Docs polish, interview-tour cards for every service,
  production-readiness sign-off.

---

## [0.8.0] &mdash; 2026-06-18

> **Customer storefront, per-service delivery, deployment wiring.** The Angular 20 signal-based
> SPA, one CI pipeline per service, helm charts for every service, and the docker-compose stack
> wired to the full platform.

### Added

#### Frontend

- `clients/freshcart-customer` &mdash; Angular 20 standalone SPA, signals for synchronous state,
  RxJS terminated with `toSignal()` for HTTP and SignalR streams.
- Feature areas: catalog browse, basket, checkout, orders, account, support chat, dashboard,
  home. Lazy-loaded routes per feature.
- Core layer: functional `authGuard`, `ErrorInterceptor` mapping status codes to typed error
  signals, `XsrfInterceptor` reading the `XSRF-TOKEN` cookie into the `X-XSRF-TOKEN` header,
  `SignalrService` singletons for the notification and support hubs with exponential-backoff
  auto-reconnect and connection state exposed as a signal.
- `proxy.conf.json` &mdash; `ng serve` proxies `/api` and `/hubs` (WebSocket upgrade) to the
  gateway at `https://localhost:7100`.
- Bootstrap 5.3 + ng-bootstrap; strict CSP, no sensitive state in `localStorage`.

#### CI/CD

- Per-service GitHub Actions workflows: `catalog-ci.yml`, `pricing-ci.yml`, `basket-ci.yml`,
  `ordering-ci.yml`, `inventory-ci.yml`, `payment-ci.yml`, `delivery-ci.yml`,
  `notification-ci.yml`, `customersupport-ci.yml`, `reviews-ci.yml`, `gateway-ci.yml`
  (alongside the existing `identity-ci.yml`).
- `spa-ci.yml` &mdash; install, lint, build, and bundle-budget check for the customer SPA.
- Every service workflow extends `reusable-build-test.yml` and `reusable-container.yml`.

#### Deployment

- Helm charts under `deploy/helm/` for catalog, pricing, basket, ordering, inventory, payment,
  delivery, notification, customersupport, reviews, and gateway, each with
  `values-dev.yaml`, `values-staging.yaml`, `values-prod.yaml`.
- `deploy/helm/freshcart` &mdash; umbrella chart aggregating the per-service charts.
- `deploy/docker/docker-compose.yaml` wired to the full backing-services topology consumed by
  the twelve services (SQL Server, Postgres, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, RabbitMQ, Seq, Prometheus,
  Grafana, OpenTelemetry Collector).

---

## [0.7.0] &mdash; 2026-06-18

> **Last-mile services and the public edge.** Delivery, Notification, CustomerSupport, Reviews,
> and the YARP gateway with the cookie-to-JWT BFF exchange.

### Added

#### Delivery (Hexagonal, Ports & Adapters, MongoDB)

- Domain ports and MongoDB adapters; geo indexes for slot and zone lookup.
- `BasketCheckoutStartedConsumer` opens a shipment; `OrderConfirmedConsumer` schedules a slot
  and publishes `DeliveryScheduledIntegrationEvent`; completion publishes
  `DeliveryCompletedIntegrationEvent`.

#### Notification (pipes-and-filters, SignalR + Redis backplane)

- `NotificationHub` pushes to connected clients through the Redis backplane.
- Consumers for `OrderPlaced`, `OrderConfirmed`, `OrderCancelled`, `OrderRefunded`,
  `PaymentFailed`, `DeliveryScheduled`, `DeliveryCompleted` fan integration events out to the
  customer's live connections.

#### CustomerSupport (stateful WebSocket, MongoDB + Redis presence)

- SignalR chat hub with round-robin agent assignment; transcripts persisted to MongoDB; agent
  presence tracked in Redis.

#### Reviews (Vertical Slice, MongoDB)

- Feature slices for submitting and listing product reviews; `OrderConfirmedConsumer` records
  verified-purchase eligibility.

#### Gateway (YARP, BFF)

- `FreshCart.Gateway.Yarp` &mdash; single public ingress; routes to every downstream service via
  Aspire service discovery.
- `CookieToJwtTokenExchanger` + `TokenExchangeTransformProvider` &mdash; the browser holds an
  opaque session cookie, the gateway mints a short-lived HS256 bearer token per identity and
  forwards it downstream; services never see the cookie. Tokens are cached per identity and
  per authentication instant so a re-authenticated principal mints a fresh token.
- `AntiforgeryValidationMiddleware` enforces the double-submit token on state-changing requests
  at the edge; rate limiting, CORS, and the shared Redis data-protection key ring configured for
  the gateway.

---

## [0.6.0] &mdash; 2026-06-18

> **Order lifecycle core.** The six services behind checkout: Catalog, Pricing, Basket,
> Ordering, Inventory, Payment, with the MassTransit saga driving stock, payment, and
> confirmation.

### Added

#### Catalog (Vertical Slice + Carter + MediatR + Marten, PostgreSQL)

- Feature slices per use case; Marten document store for the product schema.
- Publishes `ProductCreatedIntegrationEvent` and `ProductPriceChangedIntegrationEvent`.

#### Pricing (gRPC, SQLite reference data)

- Stateless price calculator on the synchronous hot path; no domain state.

#### Basket (Vertical Slice + Outbox + Decorator, PostgreSQL + Redis HybridCache)

- `CachedBasketRepository` decorator over the persistent repository; HybridCache L1 + L2.
- Checkout writes through the transactional outbox and publishes
  `BasketCheckoutStartedIntegrationEvent`.
- `ProductPriceChangedConsumer` keeps cached line prices current.

#### Ordering (Clean Architecture + DDD + MassTransit saga, SQL Server)

- Order aggregate with value objects and domain events; EF Core writes, Dapper reads.
- `CheckoutSagaStateMachine` orchestrates the flow: on `BasketCheckoutStarted` it submits the
  order and requests stock reservation, transitions through `AwaitingStockReservation` and
  `AwaitingPayment`, confirms on `PaymentCaptured`, and compensates to `Cancelled` on
  `StockReservationFailed` or `PaymentFailed`.
- Work consumers (`SubmitOrderFromCheckoutConsumer`, `ReserveOrderStockConsumer`,
  `CaptureOrderPaymentConsumer`) isolate each external side effect for testing.

#### Inventory (Layered + Dapper + gRPC, SQL Server)

- Repository + Unit of Work over Dapper; gRPC reserve endpoint on the hot path.
- `ProductCreatedConsumer` seeds stock; `OrderCancelledConsumer` releases reservations.
- Publishes `StockReservedIntegrationEvent` and `StockReservationFailedIntegrationEvent`.

#### Payment (Clean Architecture + Event Sourcing, MongoDB event store + SQL projection)

- Append-only MongoDB event store with a SQL read projection.
- Publishes `PaymentCapturedIntegrationEvent` and `PaymentFailedIntegrationEvent`.

---

## [0.5.0] &mdash; 2026-06-18

> **Shared contracts and platform hardening.** Cross-service event contracts pulled into
> BuildingBlocks, the liveness/readiness probe fix, central package consolidation, advisory
> package bumps, and the Identity MFA and data-protection additions.

### Added

- `BuildingBlocks.Messaging/IntegrationEvents` &mdash; the shared integration event contracts every
  producer and consumer binds to: `ProductCreated`, `ProductPriceChanged`,
  `BasketCheckoutStarted` (with `CheckoutAddress` and `CheckoutLine`), `OrderPlaced`,
  `OrderConfirmed` (with `OrderConfirmedLine`), `OrderCancelled`, `OrderRefunded`,
  `StockReserved`, `StockReservationFailed`, `PaymentCaptured`, `PaymentFailed`,
  `DeliveryScheduled`, `DeliveryCompleted`. Additive-only contract; breaking changes require a
  new event type.
- Identity multi-factor enrollment: `EnrollMultiFactorCommand`,
  `VerifyMultiFactorEnrollmentRequest`, `DisableMultiFactorRequest`, and the
  `MultiFactorEndpoints` Carter module (authenticator shared key + recovery codes).
- Identity data protection persisted to Redis so the cookie key ring is shared across replicas.

### Fixed

- `MapDefaultHealthEndpoints` now maps `/alive` and `/ready` in every environment instead of
  Development and Staging only. The Kubernetes liveness/readiness probes and the Docker
  HEALTHCHECK call them unconditionally; a pod whose probes returned 404 in Production was
  killed and restarted in a loop. The detailed `/health` endpoint stays Development/Staging-only
  so it does not leak dependency topology from a production cluster.

### Changed

- Central Package Management consolidation: every NuGet version moved to
  `Directory.Packages.props`; per-project version attributes removed.
- Package bumps to clear advisory and CVE findings reported by
  `dotnet list package --vulnerable`.

---

## [0.4.0] &mdash; 2026-05-25

> **Readability + coverage pass.** Stripped AI-fingerprint patterns from the most visible
> files, added the missing architecture documents (requirements, class diagrams, internal
> architecture) and a unit-test suite covering the pure-logic surface.

### Added

- `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md` &mdash; per-service functional and non-functional requirements
  with stable IDs and a traceability matrix mapping each requirement to its implementation
  and test.
- `docs/CLASS_DIAGRAMS.md` &mdash; Mermaid class diagrams for BuildingBlocks, Identity and
  Reporting plus two sequence diagrams (checkout saga, invoice generation).
- `docs/INTERNAL_ARCHITECTURE.md` &mdash; per-service deep dive: purpose, internal shape,
  state machines, technology choices with trade-offs, failure model.
- `tests/coverlet.runsettings` &mdash; shared coverage configuration with branch coverage
  and proper exclusions for migrations and bootstrap files.
- `tests/README.md` &mdash; how the five test layers fit together.
- New test project `FreshCart.BuildingBlocks.Tests` (xUnit + FluentAssertions + NSubstitute)
  with eight specs covering pagination, behaviors, exception mapping and the SSRF guard.
- `Argon2PasswordHasherTests` &mdash; parameter encoding, success / failure / rehash paths,
  salt randomness.
- `InvoiceNumberTests`, `KpiMetricTests`, `ReportingPeriodTests` &mdash; pure-domain coverage
  for the Reporting service.

### Changed

- `SignUpCommandHandler`, `SignInCommandHandler`, `IdentityDataSeeder`,
  `Argon2PasswordHasher`, `RefreshTokenService`, `ValidationBehavior`, `LoggingBehavior`,
  `CustomExceptionHandler`, `OutboundUrlAllowListHandler`, `PaginationRequest`,
  `PaginatedResult` &mdash; rewritten: stripped numbered "Steps:" comment blocks, removed
  em-dashes and marketing prose, kept only WHY-comments. Method signatures and behaviour
  preserved.
- Magic strings extracted to private const fields (`CredentialMismatchMessage`,
  `RotationReason`, `ReuseDetectedReason`, `BlockedReasonPhrase`).
- GitHub Actions build pipeline now consumes `tests/coverlet.runsettings` so coverage
  configuration lives in source control.

---

## [0.3.0] &mdash; 2026-05-25

> **Landing page.** Architecture guide promoted to `index.html` at the repo root so
> reviewers (and GitHub Pages) land directly on the walkable HTML. Demo credentials and
> seeded accounts wired end-to-end.

### Added

- `index.html` at the repo root &mdash; copy of the architecture guide, served as the
  default page by GitHub Pages / direct folder open.
- Prominent **"Try it now"** card at the top of the Overview tab listing every login URL
  (local + Azure-deployment placeholders) and the three demo credentials.
- `IdentityDataSeeder` hosted service that boots the three canonical roles
  (`Customer`, `SupportAgent`, `Administrator`) and the three demo accounts on first start
  in the Development environment. Production safety: guarded by
  `IHostEnvironment.IsDevelopment()` and the sign-up validator rejects every `*.test` email.
- Demo accounts now seeded:
  - `demo@freshcart.test` / `Demo-P@ssw0rd-2026` (Customer)
  - `support@freshcart.test` / `Support-P@ssw0rd-2026` (SupportAgent)
  - `admin@freshcart.test` / `Admin-P@ssw0rd-2026` (Administrator)
- 90-second guided tour written into both `index.html` and `README.md`.

### Changed

- `README.md` rewritten to lead with the `index.html` link, demo URLs and credentials.
  Sections beyond the demo retained verbatim.
- `CHANGELOG.md` restructured into proper gradual version history per phase (this entry,
  the v0.1.0 / v0.2.0 entries, plus retroactive v0.0.x entries for each P0 sub-phase).

---

## [0.2.0] &mdash; 2026-05-25

---

## [0.1.0] &mdash; 2026-05-25

- Application ports: `IAccessTokenIssuer`, `IRefreshTokenService`, `IIdentityAuditLog`,
  `ICurrentRequestContext`.

#### Infrastructure

- `IdentityDbContext` on SQL Server with `identity` schema, retry-on-failure.
- `Argon2PasswordHasher<ApplicationUser>` &mdash; replaces PBKDF2 with memory-hard Argon2id
  (64 MiB memory, 3 iterations, parallelism 4); stores cost parameters inline so they
  can be bumped without invalidating old hashes.
- `JwtAccessTokenIssuer` &mdash; HS256-signed access tokens, configurable lifetime.
- `RefreshTokenService` &mdash; SHA-256-hashed storage, rotation on every refresh,
  reuse detection revokes the family.
- `EntityFrameworkAuditLog`.
- EF Core configurations + per-table indexes.

#### API

- Carter modules: `AuthenticationEndpoints` (sign-up / sign-in / sign-out / refresh /
  anti-forgery-token), `AccountEndpoints` (me).
- Cookie scheme &mdash; HttpOnly + Secure + SameSite=Strict, 8-hour sliding expiry, 401/403
  responses instead of redirects.
- JWT bearer scheme for service-to-service and mobile clients.
- Anti-forgery (XSRF-TOKEN cookie + X-XSRF-TOKEN header double-submit).
- Authorization policies: `Customer`, `SupportAgent`, `Administrator`.
- Multi-stage chiselled-runtime `Dockerfile`.

#### Tests

- `SignUpAndSignInIntegrationTests` &mdash; full HTTP end-to-end against a real SQL Server
  container via Testcontainers; asserts cookie issuance + protected-endpoint access.
- `IdentityApiFactory` &mdash; `WebApplicationFactory<Program>` with `MsSqlContainer`.

#### Documentation

- `docs/interview-tour/identity.md` &mdash; 90-second pitch + 5-minute drill-down +
  15-minute architect conversation.
